## Homepage(index.html)

This HTML code is for a construction-themed website. It contains several sections such as **header**, **home**, **about**, **services**, and **projects**. Here's a breakdown of the key components and features:

### 1. **Head Section**

- **Meta tags**: Set the character encoding to UTF-8, ensure compatibility with older browsers using `X-UA-Compatible`, and set the viewport to enable responsive design for mobile devices.
- **Stylesheets**: Links to external resources for Font Awesome icons, Lightgallery for image galleries, Swiper for sliders, and a custom CSS file for styling.

### 2. **Header Section**

- **Logo**: Displays the company name "WeBuild" with a span element for styling part of the text.
- **Navigation Bar**: Contains links to various sections of the site: Home, About, Services, Projects, Pricing, Contact, and Blogs.
- **Icons**: Interactive icons for the menu, contact info, search, login, and GitHub repository. These icons are from Font Awesome and are designed to trigger specific functions when clicked.
- **Forms**: Search form to allow users to search the website, and a login form with fields for email and password, along with options like "remember me" and "forgot password."

### 3. **Contact Info Section**

- Hidden contact info section that can be triggered by clicking the "info" icon.
- Provides phone numbers, email addresses, office address, and social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn).

### 4. **Home Section**

- **Swiper Slider**: A slideshow of background images and text promoting the company's services. Each slide has a heading and description, with a "Get Started" button leading to the About section. The Swiper library is used to create the sliding effect, with next and previous buttons for navigation.

### 5. **About Section**

- Contains a video element showcasing a promotional video in the background.
- Text content describing the companyâ€™s values and services.
- **Statistics**: Displays the company's achievements (e.g., years of experience, completed projects, satisfied clients, and active workers) in a grid-like layout using `.box-container`.

### 6. **Services Section**

- **Service Boxes**: Each box represents a different service offered by the company, including building construction, house renovation, architecture design, material supply, construction consulting, interior design, building maintenance, and building renovation. Each service is accompanied by an image and a short description.

### 7. **Projects Section**

- Displays project images in a gallery format. Each project has an image, title, and category (construction, design), with a Font Awesome icon for further details. Clicking on a project opens the image in full size, likely using Lightgallery functionality (linked in the head).

### Key Technologies Used:

- **Font Awesome**: Provides the icons used throughout the site (e.g., for navigation and contact).
- **Swiper**: A library for creating a responsive slider for the home section.
- **Lightgallery**: Likely used for creating an interactive image gallery in the projects section.
- **Custom CSS (style.css)**: The main stylesheet for custom design elements such as layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
